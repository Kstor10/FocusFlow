FocusFlow Extension Icons

In a real extension, you would need to create icons in the following sizes:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

These icons would be created using a design tool like Adobe Illustrator,
Photoshop, or Figma, and would represent the FocusFlow brand.

The icons should be clean, simple, and recognizable even at the smallest size.
A simple timer or hourglass design with the FocusFlow color scheme would be appropriate.
